General Concepts
----------------------
1. Schedule Manager (aligned time availability - When2meet) 
2. Suggested activities within a local area- option for outdoor/indoor
3. Coordinate with your friends (Connect/integrate with phone contacts)
4. Event criteria (interest, budget, location, date and time)
5. Event/plan voting
6. create a calendar invite (Attend, maybe, decline)
