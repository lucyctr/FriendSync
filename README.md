Goal of the project 

**The platform for your local friend groups - where planning hangouts is simpler, faster, and easier. **

Having a hard time meeting up with your local friends? Not knowing what to do, where and when to meet, and being worried about your budget? Are you using so many platforms to organize your friend's hangouts? This web app helps you to find out when, where, and what kind of activities they are wishing to do with the local friend group based on the group's budget. Finding a fun common activity for the group to do together and the best date & time that work for the group. 

Through the platform, you will be able to manage each friend group you have. View the past hangouts with the group and create new plans for the group by filling out your interests in doing. When creating a new hangout, there is a survey that asks about which activities each person is interested in, which area they wish to go to, how much they are willing to spend, and when is the best time for them. Based on the response, there will be a plan suggested, and whenever each group member fills out the survey, the best plan will be updated. 



General Concepts
----------------------
1. Schedule Manager (aligned time availability - When2meet) 
2. Suggested activities within a local area- option for outdoor/indoor
3. Coordinate with your friends (Connect/integrate with phone contacts)
4. Event criteria (interest, budget, location, date and time)
5. Event/plan voting
6. create a calendar invite (Attend, maybe, decline)
